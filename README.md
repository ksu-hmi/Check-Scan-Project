# Check-Scan-Project - README

This project written in Phyton allow a viewing of an image of an eye and from the image, generate a subplot graph to resize and review certain portions of the image. It also has a measuerment meter to view dimensions and allow a resizing of the image vertically and horizontally. The tool also has a notepad to gather comments and save on harddrive or cloud. 

The technical approach to creating this type of tool is the use subplots from the matplotlib library. It is a 2D plotting library which generates plots, histograms and bar charts. In this project, we used matplotlib to create bar carts to show the position of the resize image from the selection of the viewer.  The subplot was added to provide a comparison of different views within the image side by side.   
This project was created by one-person team. I created a pseudo company called WHOLE SIGHT HEALTH CARE INSTITUE to discuss this new technology solution for Glaucoma prevention called the "G-EYE". The tool called the G-EYE allows clinicians to review an eye image, make an assessment and determine a diagnois to be reported to the patient or others who will be assisting the doctor. The G-EYE will help patients in rural and remote areas receive vision care. Image and Data will be loaded via mobile or machine and displayed via laptop or table. There is also a feature to load a notepad for feedback and comments. 

The MSPowerpoint and other supporting documents have been loaded.
